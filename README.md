# MNIST-Classification-Multinomial-vs-Gaussian-Naive-Bayes

### Dataset is imported from sklearn.datasets by load_digits() method.

### X.shape() reveals that there are 1797 examples and each example has 64 features.

### As, there are 64 features, each image in the dataset is a 8x8 image.

### Models are trained using fit() method as shown:

#### mnb = MultinomialNB()
#### mnb.fit(X,Y)

#### gnb = GaussianNB()
#### gnb.fit(X,Y)
